Create MLS Coverage List and Map

This project was to create a list of MLS in each state Moxi covers with the count of listings per MLS in that state.
The same query was executed based on City and Zipcode of listings.
Then, the list was used in Tableau to create a Coverage Map to show which areas of the nation Moxi covers listings in.
Each color represents a different MLS Moxi obtains real estate listings data from.
