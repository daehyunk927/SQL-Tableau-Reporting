Create a Log of Missing Image Percentages for each MLS

The query was to make a daily report on what percentage of images each MLS is missing in the listings.
The goal was 90% of MLS's have less than 5% missing image rates and 50% having less than 2% missing image rates.
The result of work put into reducing the missing image rates was then graphed in Tableau.
